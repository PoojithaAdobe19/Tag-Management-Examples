# Adobe Launch Tag Implementation

## Objective:
Implement and track a purchase button click event on a demo webpage.

## Steps:
1. **Create a Data Element**: 
   - Create a data element in Adobe Launch to capture the `purchaseButtonClick` event.
2. **Create a Rule**: 
   - Create a rule in Adobe Launch that fires the analytics event when the button is clicked.
3. **Set Up Analytics Action**: 
   - Configure the action to send the event data to Adobe Analytics when the rule is triggered.

## Debugging:
- Use Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger to ensure that the event fires correctly and the data is being sent to Adobe Analytics.
